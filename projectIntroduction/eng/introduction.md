# Hearing Loss Emulation

## About the Project
This website was developed by a hearing-impaired programmer to demonstrate that speaking louder is not always enough for people with hearing difficulties to understand. Often, people with hearing loss still face challenges, even if a sound seems loud.

## Types of Hearing Loss
Hearing loss can vary, and the types depend on which frequencies a person struggles to hear. Understanding these differences is important because the approaches to communicating with people who have hearing loss can differ significantly.

### High-Frequency Hearing Loss
This type of hearing loss is the most common and is characterized by an inability to perceive high frequencies. This means that sounds such as hissing or whistling sounds in speech (like "s," "sh," "f") may be faint or even unrecognizable. As a result, words may sound muffled and less clear, even if spoken loudly. People with high-frequency hearing loss can often hear low sounds well but may have difficulty understanding speech, especially in noisy environments.

### Low-Frequency Hearing Loss
With low-frequency hearing loss, a person has more difficulty perceiving low sounds. This can include background noises, such as the rumble of engines or wind. In everyday life, this may manifest as difficulty perceiving the depth of voices, particularly male voices. Additionally, people with this type of hearing loss may struggle to distinguish vowel sounds, as they often have low-frequency components. However, they can hear higher-pitched sounds, like a ringing phone, much better than low-pitched ones.

### Why Is This Important?
Understanding the types of hearing loss helps recognize that some people can manage by simply hearing louder speech, while for others, that is not enough. For example, a person with high-frequency hearing loss may still miss important details in speech even if the volume is increased because the issue lies in the frequencies they cannot perceive.

Therefore, the approach to communicating with people who have different types of hearing loss should take their unique needs into account, and the simulation on this website helps convey what it is like to live with hearing difficulties.
